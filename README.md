If you've dug this far into my github repo, that means that you're checking out my work, and I am extremely flattered :bowtie:

A bit about myself (if you don't mind): 
My name is Will, and I graduated with a degree in bioengineering from McGill University back in 2020. I then went on to do a degree in epidemiology at Yale University, where I took fun courses across traditional epidemiology, biostatistics, as well as a CS course in data structures. I'm currently working as a data scientist at [Astrana Health](https://www.astranahealth.com), building machine learning (*as well as a lot of traditional statistical/rule-based tools*) to provide targeted interventions that can hopefully dent the cost of healthcare. 

### Why "Build From Scratch"?
In my day job, I'm often asked to produce analysis or build tools/models on a tight deadline -- often deploying packages and tools that I have a broad understanding of, but with the nitty gritty details abstracted away. The goal of "building from scratch" is really a personal learning project, where I want to get to solidiy my understanding behind an algorithm, different optimization decisions that are implictly made when using an off-the-shelf package, with the goal of becoming a better programmer + better statistician.

### So, kind of like Stardew Valley of Data Science.
Eric Barone, the (sole) creator of Stardew, is a point of inspiration for me, as he built the widely popular game Stardew Valley [all by himself](https://www.shortform.com/blog/how-was-stardew-valley-made/#:~:text=Did%20one%20person%20really%20create,to%2015%20hours%20a%20day.). While I am not likely to put in as much time as he did in developing the entire game, I admire his curiosity and passion for his craft, which is something I hope to bring into my own work/career as well.
