If you've dug this far into my github repo, that means that you're checking out my work, and I am extremely flattered :bowtie:

A bit about myself (if you don't mind): 
My name is Will, and I graduated with a degree in bioengineering from McGill University back in 2020. I then went on to do a degree in epidemiology at Yale University, where I took fun courses across traditional epidemiology, biostatistics, as well as a CS course in data structures. I'm currently working as a data scientist at [Astrana Health](https://www.astranahealth.com), building machine learning (*as well as a lot of traditional statistical/rule-based tools*) to provide targeted interventions that can hopefully dent the cost of healthcare.
